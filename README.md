## **How to Play**

1. **Choose Your Bet:**
   - You start with a set amount of money. Choose your bet wisely! You can choose from several options, ranging from small amounts like 50 to more substantial bets like 5000. Or, if you're feeling lucky, go "All In!" **You can‚Äôt play it safe all the time**, sometimes you have to make that **bold move**, just like Harvey in a courtroom.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - After placing your bet, you and the dealer will be dealt two cards each. Your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
   - You can **Hit** (take another card), **Stand** (stick with your hand), or **Double** (double your bet and take exactly one more card).
   - Make your move. **It‚Äôs not about the cards, it‚Äôs about how you play them**. **Channel your inner Harvey Specter** ‚Äî **"You‚Äôre not a lawyer, you‚Äôre a closer!"**

3. **Dealer's Turn:**
   - After you make your decision, the dealer will reveal their hand and play according to the standard Blackjack rules: the dealer will continue to draw cards until their hand totals 17 or more.
   - Like in the courtroom, you‚Äôll have to read your opponent‚Äôs moves ‚Äî **don‚Äôt just play the cards, play the situation.**

4. **Winning and Losing:**
   - If you beat the dealer‚Äôs hand without busting (going over 21), you win! You‚Äôll earn double your bet if you use the ‚ÄúDouble‚Äù option and win.
   - If you bust, you lose your bet. If the dealer busts, you win! **Remember, in this game, losing is part of the strategy** ‚Äî just like in **Suits**, sometimes you lose the battle but win the war.

5. **Play Again or Quit:**
   - After each round, you can choose to play again or quit. Just remember, the house always has an edge, but with skill and luck, you might just outsmart the dealer. **It‚Äôs not about winning every hand; it‚Äôs about playing your hand the best way you can.**

## **Game Functions**

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of all the key functions within **DeckSmith**:

### 1. **`create_deck()`**
   - **Purpose:** Creates a shuffled deck of cards.
   - **Details:** The deck consists of 4 copies of each card (2-10, J, Q, K, A), which is shuffled to add randomness. **Just like a good negotiation, you can never predict the outcome, but you can control how you play the hand.**

### 2. **`calculate_hand_value(hand)`**
   - **Purpose:** Calculates the total value of the player‚Äôs or dealer‚Äôs hand.
   - **Details:** The value of face cards (J, Q, K) is 10, and the Ace (A) is valued at 11, unless that would cause the hand to bust, in which case it is counted as 1. **Play it right ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing when to leverage the value of your Ace, just like Harvey knows when to leverage his charm.**

### 3. **`display_hands(player_hand, dealer_hand, show_dealer_full_hand=False)`**
   - **Purpose:** Displays the hands of both the player and the dealer on the screen.
   - **Details:** The player‚Äôs hand is always fully visible, but the dealer‚Äôs second card is hidden until the player has finished making their decisions. **The power of information ‚Äî sometimes knowing when to hold back is just as important as knowing when to reveal your cards.**

### 4. **`draw_button(text, x, y, w, h, color)`**
   - **Purpose:** Draws a clickable button on the screen for user interaction.
   - **Details:** Buttons are used for actions like "Hit", "Stand", and "Double". The color and text can be customized. **Just like a lawyer presents the perfect case, every button press is part of your strategy.**

### 5. **`select_bet(player_money)`**
   - **Purpose:** Allows the player to choose their bet for the round.
   - **Details:** The function displays a range of betting options based on the player's available money. The player can choose a predefined amount or go "All In". **Never bet more than you're willing to lose, but never bet too little to miss the big win ‚Äî play it like Harvey!**

### 6. **`blackjack_game()`**
   - **Purpose:** Runs the entire Blackjack game loop.
   - **Details:** The game alternates between the player‚Äôs turn (where they can choose "Hit", "Stand", or "Double") and the dealer‚Äôs turn. It then calculates the winner and updates the player‚Äôs money. **It‚Äôs a game of calculation and timing ‚Äî just like closing a deal.**

## **Game Tips**

- **Play the Man(or AI), not the odds:** Blackjack is a game of strategy and luck. Always keep track of the cards you‚Äôve already seen, and remember, the dealer must hit until they have 17 or more. **Think like Harvey ‚Äî know when the game is in your favor and take the right risks.**
- **Know When to Double:** Doubling down can be a great way to increase your winnings, but only do so when the odds are in your favor‚Äîespecially when you have a total of 10 or 11. **Strategize like Louis Litt: Calculate your next move carefully before you go all in.**
- **Keep Your Cool:** Emotional decisions lead to mistakes. Stay calm and calculated when you make your moves. **Just like Jessica Pearson says, "You always have a choice, you just need to make it wisely."**
- **Bet Wisely:** Don‚Äôt bet too much in the early rounds unless you‚Äôre confident. Betting the minimum allows you to play more rounds and improve your strategy. **Remember, sometimes it‚Äôs better to win slowly, but steadily, like Harvey ‚Äî rather than make a risky, all-in move that could cost you everything.**
Know When to Hold ‚ÄòEm:

If your hand is already strong (like a total of 18 or 19), it might be best to stand and let the dealer sweat.
Don't Be Afraid to Double:

If you have a strong hand (say, 10 or 11), doubling your bet could give you a big payout. But keep an eye on your money‚Äîgambling too much can make you lose it all.
Avoid Risky Bets:

Betting too high early on could end your game before you even start. Play it safe until you get a feel for the dealer‚Äôs strategy.
Card Counting (Sort of):

If you‚Äôre really good, try to keep track of high and low cards. This is, of course, against real-world casino rules, but DeckSmith is a friendly way to practice your counting skills.

Make sure you‚Äôre not betting all your chips on a single hand. The game is more about consistency and smart betting than pure luck.
